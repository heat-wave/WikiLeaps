# WikiLeaps
## Android course project at ITMO University, fall 2015

WikiLeaps is an educational game with simple rules: starting at a random Wikipedia page, get to the target article
using only links from one article to another.  You may try to make as few leaps as possible for the real competitive
feel, or read every article to broaden your scope of vision â€” the choice is yours! Learn more about the world around
you every time you start a new game in WikiLeaps.
